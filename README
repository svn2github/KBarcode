Project Description:
====================
KBarcode is a barcode and label printing application for Linux and KDE 3. It can
be used to print every thing from simple business cards up to complex
labels with several barcodes (e.g. article descriptions). KBarcode
comes with an easy to use WYSIWYG label designer, a setup wizard,
batch import of labels (directly from the delivery note), thousands
of predefined labels, database managment tools and translations
in many languages. Even printing more than 10.000 labels in one go is
no problem for KBarcode. Additionally it is a simply xbarcode
replacement for the creation of barcodes. All major types of barcodes
like EAN, UPC, CODE39, DataMatrix and ISBN are supported.

It works of course on any platform supported by KDE and not only Linux!
